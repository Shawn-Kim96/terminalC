The Bollinger Bands (BB) were in a tight range, with the middle band at $20.03, indicating volatility.\n",

      "**Divergence Analysis:**\n",
      "A Bullish Divergence was observed in the 15-minute timeframe, with an entry price of $31.41 and a price change of 0.46. This indicates a possible reversal in the downtrend.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Correlation Analysis:**\n",
      "The correlation between the price drop and technical indicators is evident, as the bearish RSI and MACD values indicate a sell signal. However, the Bullish Divergence in the 15-minute timeframe suggests a possible reversal, which might have contributed to the price drop.\n",
