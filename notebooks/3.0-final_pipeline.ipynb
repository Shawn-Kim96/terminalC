      "Operating Principles:\n",
      "1. Treat the supplied context tables as ground truth—cite concrete metrics, timestamps, or symbols from them.\n",
      "2. If information is missing, say so explicitly and request the missing metric instead of hallucinating.\n",
      "3. Tie every claim to observable data (e.g., RSI, MACD, volume trends) and keep the narrative actionable.\n",
      "4. Highlight risks or confidence levels when the data is mixed or inconclusive.\n",
